My friend [Hunter Brown](https://www.hbstudioart.com/) is an amazing artist, and I've been particularly taken by one of their pieces, called "Band Names (An Ongoing Accumulation)." It's a list of over 600 potential band names, ranging from funny to dead serious (mostly funny, though).

I offered to work with Hunter to translate the piece into a website, and that's what this repository represents. There's also an (unfinished) version of the website up and running right now at [this link](http://qbat10.pythonanywhere.com/).
